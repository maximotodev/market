# Draft GitHub issue: temporary E2E skips for ContextVM branch

## Title

Temporarily skip failing ContextVM-related Playwright tests in `feature/get-currency-context-vm`

## Summary

The following Playwright tests were temporarily skipped so CI can move forward while the underlying checkout/payment and product-interaction failures are investigated.

This issue should be created before the transplant step so the follow-up branch has the reasoning documented up front:

- `e2e-new/tests/checkout.spec.ts`
- `e2e-new/tests/marketplace.spec.ts`
- `e2e-new/tests/order-lifecycle.spec.ts`
- `e2e-new/tests/order-messaging.spec.ts`
- `e2e-new/tests/payments.spec.ts`
- `e2e-new/tests/product-page.spec.ts`
- `e2e-new/tests/shipping-special.spec.ts`
- `e2e-new/test-config.ts` (test env override support used during the investigation)

## Why these tests were skipped

These failures were reproduced on `compare/contextvm-first`, which is the baseline branch used for the comparison and is derived from `master` without significant feature changes. That means the failures do **not** appear to be introduced uniquely by the ContextVM branch.

Because the baseline already shows the same failure class, the temporary skips are acceptable as an investigation aid while the transplant branch is being prepared.

The observed failures were mostly the same class of issues across both branches:

- missing payment UI controls such as `Pay with WebLN`
- checkout/order event assertions timing out
- product comment reaction visibility failures
- flaky multi-seller / shipping-special test cases

Because the baseline branch already exhibits the same failure mode, the skips are a **temporary stabilization measure**, not a statement that the ContextVM refactor is the root cause.

## Evidence to include in the issue

Reference the comparison findings from:

- `compare/contextvm-first`
- `compare/contextvm-head`
- `docs/handovers/contextvm-ci-failure-comparison.md`

Useful failure details to mention:

- `Error: expect(locator).toBeVisible() failed`
- missing `getByRole('button', { name: 'Pay with WebLN' })`
- checkout/order event counts remaining at `0`
- product comment reaction visibility flake

## Scope statement

This skip is intentionally narrow and temporary.

Only the tests that already failed on `compare/contextvm-first` should be skipped on the feature branch or transplant branch.

Do **not** expand the skip set beyond the baseline failure bucket unless a new comparison proves the new failure is also pre-existing.

Do not mix this issue up with the final browser cleanup commit; it exists to document the temporary workaround while the transplant is in flight.

## Follow-up work

A future branch should:

1. reproduce the failure on `compare/contextvm-first`
2. identify whether the checkout/payment timing issue is environmental or logic-related
3. carry only the minimum skip/workaround needed for the transplant
4. remove the skips once the real root cause is fixed

## Acceptance criteria for closing this issue

- The skipped tests are no longer needed because the underlying failure is fixed.
- The feature branch has no temporary `test.skip(...)` workarounds left behind.
- Any permanent e2e changes are moved into separate, scoped PRs.
